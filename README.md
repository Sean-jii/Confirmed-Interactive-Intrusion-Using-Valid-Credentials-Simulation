# Confirmed-Interactive-Intrusion-Using-Valid-Credentials-Simulation
This project simulates a post-compromise intrusion against a Windows 10 Azure VM. Using only built-in Windows tools and valid credentials, the attacker progresses from access to persistence and data staging. Defender telemetry is correlated to identify ten behavioral flags, mirroring real SOC threat-hunting workflows.
